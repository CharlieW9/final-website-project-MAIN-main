    <p class="code-text">This is my second week of learning how to use HTML/
    CSS in which we focused on how to use simplistic CSS functions such as changing font families and colours.On top
of this we also learnt how to import and resize images, all of this was new to me however, i found these tasks relatively
easy to start with. Along with this I learnt how to use Github and how to host my own work on a repository while using Github desktop,
this has been a very helpful tool in creating my work and the links to my repository's will be below.

    <p class="code-text2" > For the next task, week 3 I learned how to use
    CSS in more depth such as using a flexbox and adding a second stylesheet to my
    work. The week 3 task had a lot more images and text and allowed for a good understanding on how flexbox's 
    worked which was very useful. As well as this I learned how to use class selectors which allows me to apply
    a different style to certain tags, a class selector can either be used to keep consistency with designs or to 
    create specific designs
    <br><br>For the fourth week we went further into flexbox as week 3 was mainly an intro to flexboxing,
in this week we learnt how to flexbox a menu and many different flexbox styles in css. We also learnt about centering images using flexbox
and adding videos and audio to our websites, overall the fourth week was an important week in helping to give me the knowledge to start
my own website as I had the base knowledge of how to execute my plan. 

<br><br>Week 5 is where we learnt how to use buttons, create footers and also how to use custom fonts. Week 5 built on my knowledge further however,
I didn't find it as important as the other worksheets as the information inside the worksheet wasn't as impoertant
compared to the past weeks as I already had the base knowledge to start my own website.
