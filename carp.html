                  <p class="carp-text"> With my desings I wanted them to all to have similar features to one another and decided to
                    create a white border around all the desings while keeping the same colour pallete and font to keep consistency 
                    within my designs. In my first design I aimed to use proximity by creating small borders between the images to group all the related images together from the 
                    bristol balloon fiesta website to make them look like one connected group of images instead of unrelated sections.
                    I also aimed to use allignment in my text to make it easier to read and flow down from the top to the bottom of the design in order.

             <p class="carp-text"> With my second design I aimed to create a central focal point, I did this by having my vibrant central image
                contrast the other darker and dimmer images which helped to create a central point in my design that I could then work around. This worked effectively
                as the darker images match my colour pallete of the dark grey. I also used dilatational typography around my central image to further emphasise the central point.
                For the text I used Arial Black for a nice bold feeling while also matching the yellow colour of the main headline to the colour of the central point to emphasise the importance
                of the text.

                <p class="carp-text">Finally, on my third design I aimed to create a partially modular design to split up the text in the centre to make it easier to
                    read, I furthered this design by seperating the text with barries to keep the text on it's own. I also added images on the top and bottom and of the
                      design to split up the design into thirds to help the design flow down the page a lot better.
