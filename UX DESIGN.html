            <p class="UX-text" >Here are my wireframes showing the early thought process behind my website layout
                and how I wanted everything set out. When first creating my website I knew I wanted my users to be 
                able to easily navigate my website with no confusion, one way I aimed to do so was to include
                sub-headings in my navigation bar so the user could easily see what page they were on which was emphasised
                by a bold font weight. As well as this, I wanted minimal scrolling on my website and so avoided creating
                a single-scrolling design for my website, one of the main reasons for this was due to the fact I wanted
                my users to be able to easily find their way through my site which sometimes I find difficult when using a 
                single-scrolling designed website.
                
        
            </p>

        </div>




        I made sure each link went to it's own page, e.g you have to click on the 'typography' heading 
        in order to get to the typography page, instead of being able to scroll down and find the page from another
        linked page.
